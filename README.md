## Security

### ðŸ”’ Token Encryption (Level 1 - Implemented)

Session tokens are now encrypted using AES-256-CBC encryption for enhanced security:

-   **Automatic Migration:** Existing plain JSON tokens are automatically encrypted on first run
-   **Secure Storage:** Tokens stored in `session_tokens.enc` with restricted file permissions
-   **Environment Configuration:** Encryption key stored in `.env` file (never commit this!)

#### Quick Setup:

1. Generate a secure encryption key:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

2. Add to your `.env` file:
   ```env
   TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_generated_64_character_hex_key
   ```

3. Test encryption:
   ```bash
   node test-encryption.js
   ```

For advanced security options (token hashing, JWT, database storage), see [SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md](SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md).

## Multi-User System

The application now includes a comprehensive multi-user system with role-based access control:

### User Roles

-   **Admin**: Full system access
    -   Can create, update, and delete users
    -   Can view and manage all sessions
    -   Can monitor all user activities
    -   Can delete system logs
    
-   **User**: Limited access
    -   Can only view and manage their own sessions
    -   Cannot delete system logs
    -   Cannot access user management

### Initial Setup

1. On first run, a default admin account is created:
   - Email: `admin@localhost`
   - Password: Value of `ADMIN_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` from `.env`

2. Admin users can create additional users through:
   - Web interface: `/admin/users.html`
   - API: `POST /api/v1/users` (requires admin role)

### User Authentication

Users can log in using:
- Email and password (for multi-user system)
- Legacy admin password (for backward compatibility)

### Activity Logging

All user actions are logged and encrypted:
- Login attempts
- Session creation/deletion
- Message sending
- User management actions

Admins can view all activities at `/admin/activities.html`

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
-   npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Alucard0x1/Super-Light-Web-WhatsApp-API-Server.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Super-Light-Web-WhatsApp-API-Server
    ```
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
    **For cPanel or environments without Python:**
    ```bash
    npm run install:smart
    ```
    This will automatically handle bcrypt compatibility issues.

## Usage

### For Production

To start the server, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

### For Development

To start the server with `nodemon` (which automatically restarts on file changes):

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `PORT` environment variable).

## ðŸš€ Deployment

### cPanel Hosting

### Other Deployment Options

- **VPS/Cloud**: Use the production scripts (`start-production.sh` or `start-production.bat`)
- **PM2**: Configuration included in `ecosystem.config.js`
- **Docker**: Coming soon

## Admin Dashboard

Access the dashboard by navigating to `/admin/dashboard.html` in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/admin/dashboard.html`).

The dashboard is the central hub for managing your WhatsApp gateway. It allows you to:
-   **Create new sessions:** Simply enter a unique ID and click "Create".
-   **Monitor session status:** See at a glance which sessions are connected, disconnected, or require a QR scan.
-   **Authenticate sessions:** Click "Get QR" to generate a code, then scan it with your WhatsApp mobile app.
-   **Test all API functionality:** Use the "API Control Center" to send messages, upload files with previews, and see example API calls in real-time.
-   **View live logs:** See a stream of events from the server to monitor activity and debug issues.

## API Documentation

For complete, interactive testing and usage examples, please use the **API Control Center** on the Admin Dashboard. A summary of the API structure is provided below.

### Authentication

All API requests to the `/api/v1/*` endpoints must be authenticated using a Bearer Token in the `Authorization` header, **except for**:
- `POST /api/v1/sessions` - Requires Master API Key (see below) OR admin dashboard login
- `GET /api/v1/sessions` - Lists all sessions (public information)

**Session Creation Authentication:**
- **Via API**: Requires `X-Master-Key` header with the master API key from `.env`
- **Via Admin Dashboard**: No API key needed when logged in as admin

Your session token is returned when creating a session and also displayed in the dashboard.

**Header Formats:**
- Session operations: `Authorization: Bearer <your_session_token>`
- Create session (API): `X-Master-Key: <your_master_api_key>`

*Legacy endpoints do not require authentication.*

### Legacy API Endpoints

**Base URL:** `/api`

| Method | Endpoint        | Description                                      |

-   **Session Data:** Authentication data for each session is stored in the `auth_info_baileys` directory. Deleting a session via the dashboard or API will remove its corresponding folder.
-   **Media Storage:** Uploaded files are stored in the `media` directory in the project root.
-   **Terms of Service:** Ensure your use of this gateway complies with WhatsApp's terms of service.
